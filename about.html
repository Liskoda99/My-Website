<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Call me Koda. This is quite ironic considering what i'm doing right now:coding. One thing I love is music, the other thing... you guessed right! I mean who doesn't love football.
Graduating from KNUST graduate with urban planning skills, to having switched up to web development world because I believe I can.</p>

<p>What motivated me to pursue this journey is the fact that I can work anytime at my own comfort.</p>

<p>I wanna change the world in my own way. Being humble and kind is my prayer. I wanna travel across the globe and see the world in my own lens. </p>
